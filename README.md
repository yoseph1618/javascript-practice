This is a personal project I have taken to practice what I've learned, what I'm learning, and things I'll learn in the future.  This project is used to stretch my knowledge and expand my understand of how to go about complex code.

## Rules and notes: ##
A fighting game where the player has to take on waves of enemies that slowly get harder and harder.
Choose 1 of 8 different characters that best matches your desired play style.
The different mechanics within this game are as follows:
Your character starts off at level 1 with their respective base stats.  Those stats are based around the games base character stats which are shown below.
100 HP
3 armor
3 hope
4 speed
25 rng
2 atk
120 atpm

Whenever a player gains enough xp, they level up. Max level is 10.  Whenever a player gains a level, their stats are increased by a percentage.  

### The stats and what they do; ###
    Your HP number is the max amount of hit points you can have which starting is 100.
    Your armor number is how much reduced damage is dealt to your character. In this case every hit you recieve deals 3 less damage.
    Your hope is how much additional healing you recieve when healed.  in this case whenever you recieve health or healing, you gain an additional 3 hp.  In addition to this, whenever you kill something you are healed based on the amount of hope you have.  So with 3 hope, whenever you kill an enemy, you heal 3 hp.
    Your speed is how fast your character moves around.
    Your rng or "Range" is how far your attack can reach to damage enemies.
    Your atk is how much base damage you deal whenever you attack.  In this case you deal a whopping 2 damage for every attack.
    Finally your atpm is your attack speed or "attacks per minute", how fast you can attack something. Base atpm is 120 meaning you can attack once every half a second.

### Characters; ###
    Archer:  a long ranged fighter with low hp and damage output but quick movement and attacks.
    Musketeer: a long ranged fighter with high damage output but slower attack speed.
    Monk: a close ranged fighter with strong healing capabilities.
    Ninja: a close ranged fighter with incredible speed to get in and out of places.
    Bruiser:  a close ranged fighter with high hp and armor capabilities but slow move speed.
    Vampire: a close ranged fighter with decent move speed and high healing properties for themselves.
    Wizard:  a long ranged fighter with low hp, armor, movement, and attack speed, but incredible damage output.
    Mechanic:  a long ranged fighter that relies on their inventions to do their fighting for them.

### Items and Upgrades; ###
    There are items in this game and each one gives the player specific stats.  You may choose what items to put on your character depending on what stats you want improved or changed.
    Upgrades are obtained through points.  Every time you hit an enemy with an attack, you receive a certain amount of points.  With enough points you can upgrade stats, obtain new attacks, and more.  This is where the player will really decide how they want their character to be played and handled.


## SPECIAL GAME MECHANIC(S): ##
### Social aspects; ###
    Each character has a simple social construct divided into two sections called Friends and enemies.  For friends, that means when the character you are playing as is within a certain proximity to a character they consider a friend, certain benefits are granted and shared.  An example of this would be the the archer and monk characters being close together as they consider eachother friends.  
    
    As for enemies, although the word sounds harsh, this simply means when characters are played together that are considered enemies they lose buffs when in close proximity and gain buffs when away from eachother.
